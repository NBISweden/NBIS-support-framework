# A template for NBIS support projects

This is a template for Short-/Medium-term Support projects at NBIS, and is
intended to be a starting point for new projects. The structure is based on
Conda and Snakemake, with the aim of both increasing reproducibility and
transparency as well as facilitating code re-use and teamwork.
