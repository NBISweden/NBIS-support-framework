# Administrative information

This is the `admin` directory, in which you can find information regarding NBIS
administrative matter, such as consultation guidelines, contract templates and
other useful things.

**Links:**
 * The [Redmine issue][redmine-issue] for NBIS-SF is **#4646**
 * [NBIS website][nbis-web]
 * [Contract templates][nbis-contract]
 * [Documents and forms][nbis-docs]
 * [Timelogging examples][nbis-time] for short-term experts
 * [Routines][nbis-routines] for short-term projects

**TODO:**
Are the some links superfluous or useful (*i.e.* NBIS/Redmine wiki links)?

**TODO:** Potentially incorporate (or more explicitly link / add as submodule)
the [NBIS-templates-contract][nbis-contract] repo.
