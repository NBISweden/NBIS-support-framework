## Reimbursements

To get the money back from your travels, different universities seem to follow
different procedures. However, Primula is a system used at Lund and Stockholm
University. This is a page most of the administration related to your employment
including travels, vacation and many others are managed. Here, you can start
an issue for each of your travel and upload your tickets to the respective
issue. The system will then calculate the amount that you will get reimbursed
and it will be automatically sent to your financial administrator. However, you
 need to have a bit more information like the financial account number your
 employment is related to and so on. This you can obtain from your financial
 administrator in your local department. Below are the links for the
 employees at Lund  and Stockholm University
