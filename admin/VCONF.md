# Conference calls at SciLifeLab

SciLifeLab has five virtual conference rooms called SciLifeLab@vconf.kth.se,
SciLifeLab2@vconf.kth.se and so on, all the way through
SciLifeLab5@vconf.kth.se. These can be used for video meetings either with
NBIS colleagues on other sites, or with groups. In order to use these virtual
conference rooms, there are a number of things you need to do beforehand:

 1. Go to the [SciLifeLab intranet room booking][scilife-intra] and select
    "Virtual conference room"
 2. Find the day and time of interest and make a booking

After having booked a timeslot at either of the rooms, you are ready! At the
time of the meeting, you need simply to do the following:

 1. Go to [https://vconf.kth.se][]
 2. If the web browser asks for permission to use your camera and microphone,
    answer "yes"
 3. Enter the name that you wish to use for the call
 4. Click "Call"
 5. In the box that appears, type the address to the virtual room you booked,
    *e.g.* SciLifeLab4@vconf.kth.se
 6. Enter either the PIN 8800 (if you are joining a call) or 8808 (if you are
    hosting the call)

Just share the address of the virtual room you booked with other people that
will join the call, and you're all set! Have them follow the instructions
above, using the 8800 PIN, while you yourself use 8808.

You can also read more about the video conference system at the
