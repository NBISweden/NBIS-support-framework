# Data

This is the `data` directory, in which you can store raw or processed data 
needed for your analyses. Use subdirectories to separate different types of
data for example:

- **deliveries**: Read-only copies of data delivered from a sequencing facility.
- **raw-data**: Linked or read-only data used as input for your analyses.
- **results**/**output**: Processed data resulting from performed analyses.
- **frozen**/**publish**: Data that should be published from results.

Alternatively you may prefer to put some of these folders in the root of this
repository instead and use this folder purely for raw-data.
