# Data management

This is the `data_management` directory, containing information and guidelines
regarding data management and how to help clients plan for their data
acquisition and storage. There is a [Data Management Plan][nbis-dmp]
work-in-progress (created by Niclas Jareborg), from which a light-weight
version aimed at short-term projects should be created.

**TODO:** create the light-weight DMP for short-term projects.
