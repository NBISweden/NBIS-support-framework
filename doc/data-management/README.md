# Data management

This is the `data-management` directory, containing information and guidelines
regarding data management and how to help clients plan for their data
acquisition and storage.

A light version document to be created based on work-in-progress DMPs, incl.
- [Data Management Plan][nbis-dmp], created by Niclas Jareborg, Yvonne Kallberg, Hanna Kultima
- [Data Management Guidelines][nbis-dmp-guidelines], created by Bj√∂rn Nystedt, Niclas Jareborg, Markus (?)  

**TODO:**
- get feedback and improve DMP-light version
- less or more information?
- create a more practical version, from life scientist's point of view, from experts' point of view?
- case study examples?
- how the DMP information should be collected, stored and shared with NBIS?
