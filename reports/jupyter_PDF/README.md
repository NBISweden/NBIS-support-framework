The file `Example.ipynb` includes the necessary steps to convert your jupyter
notebook into a pdf file for reporting. You may costumize it according to your 
needs according to [the ipypublish documentation](https://ipypublish.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  

An example output file (`converted/Example.pdf`) and example code blocks are also included in this template.  

Note that you need the folder `ipypublish`, but the `example` folder only contains files for demonstration
 purposes - for instance, it includes a sample `.bib` file to use for bibliography, and a sample image to 
demonstrate how to include external images.
